## Hello There!

Welcome to my blog! This is the first time I've ever done anything like this so it will be quite the learning experience for me.

## What I'm up to Right Now

It's a busy time for me right now. I've completed my third year of undergrad at Western and I'm deep into my summer internship with Western's Innovation and Strategic Partnerships team. Perhaps with this in mind, it's kind of strange that I decided to finally build my website and blog, but I tend to enjoy making myself even more busy. 

It's not all work though (plus I don't think of this project as work at all); I've been doing my fair share of relaxing, going out to eat, and plenty of other activities. I recently completed one of the more major mods to my 3d printer, a [Kingroon KP3S Pro V2](https://kingroon.com/products/kingroon-kp3s-pro-v2-with-klipper-firmware), where I managed to fit a [Voron Stealthburner](https://vorondesign.com/voron_stealthburner) printhead onto it. It was quite an interesting experience but I enjoyed the process, as well as the improved printing! The next step is to modify the printer to have dual y-axis. It will be quite a challenging mod, but I'm excited to see how it goes!

## What's next

There's plenty to come! I plan to continue blogging, but I am not sure at what pace. I will try to vary the topics as much as I can, with some personal blogs and perhaps some computer science focused ones as well. In terms of projects, I've been pushing a couple friends to join me in developing some interesting projects, so I hope to have some interesting things to share soon! All this to say, stay tuned!
